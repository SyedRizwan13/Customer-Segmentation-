# Customer-Segmentation-
Customer Segmentation is unsupervised method of targeting the customers in order to increase sales and market goods in a better way  
This project deals with a real time data where we have to segment the customers in the form f clusters using K-Means algorithm 
The data set consist of important variables like Age, Gender, annual income etc.
With the help of the help of the algorithms we can easily visualize the data and can get segmentation of each customers so that we can target the customers in the better way

Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enables a program(software) to learn from the experiences and improve their self at a task without being explicitly programmed. For example, how would you write a program that can identify fruits based on their various properties, such as color, shape, size or any other
Machine Learning today has all the attention it needs. Machine Learning can automate many tasks, especially the ones that only humans can perform with their innate intelligence. Replicating this intelligence to machines can be achieved only with the help of machine learning. 

In this project we have used Anaconda which have various inbuilt software's like Spyder, R , PyCharm , Jupyter and much more
For this specific project we have used Jupyter notebook to run the codes 
Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment

K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.
The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided.
Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.
